# Slack

This Meetup uses Slack as communication and collaboration platform. The history of the free version is limited to 90 days however. Since this Meetup kicked off on January 27<sup>th</sup>, 2023 the information will get lost once the trial period is over.

Hence this MarkDown where you'll find (useful) information that passed through the different channels.

A move has been made to [Discord](https://discord.gg/cWEnNX6W).

## Spaces

Before ending up at the Central Library, a couple of other locations where viewed, contacted or visited.

- [Fablab Den Haag](https://www.fablabdenhaag.nl/faciliteiten/index.php) Limited opening hours.
- [Fablab Mariahoeve Wiki](https://fablabmariahoeve.nl/) and [Meetup](https://meetu.ps/c/42p7z/wnpZ6/a) Part of [Middin Zwedenburg](https://middin.nl/zwedenburg) They don’t have a membership fee (yet). Basically it’s an agreement with Middin to help the community and their clients, e.g. with their greenhouse or plant watering system. There are a couple of 3D printers, a clay printer, lasercutter and other tools present, much like a makerspace. The tools need some TLC, so not really usable at the moment. Storage can be created. They meetup on Saturdays from 11am till 6pm. If we want another day (or evening) we can contact management at Middin. Maybe the usage of the space can be compensated with providing materials or create a tip-jar.
- [RevSpace](https://revspace.nl/Main_Page) Awesome facilities, but that comes with a cost.
- [Titaan](https://titaan.nl/kantoorruimte-huren/) Might be almost for free (in the beginning at least) to help them activate the community. But also no facilities (yet) like 3D printers and lasercutters and stuff. Just a 'workbench' and maybe some storage space.
- [The Hague University of Applied Sciences](https://www.thuas.com/)
- [The Hague Tech](https://www.thehaguetech.com/) Not an option.
- [Impact City](https://www.impactcity.nl/en/)
- [Apollo 14](https://www.apollo14.nl/)
- [Q42](https://www.q42.nl/en) and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/q42/)

Out of our The Hague way:

- https://www.makerspacedelft.nl
- https://makerspaceleiden.nl
- and a lot of them in and around Amsterdam.
