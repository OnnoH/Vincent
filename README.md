# Vincent

A community project from the [Arduino/Rasperry Pi Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/den-haag-arduino-raspberry-pi/) in The Hague and present on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/denhaagarduin-btu2346/shared_invite/zt-1of5vfttc-zs8Z8Dnin0fzIw_Z6SpeCQ) as well.

## Introduction

Vincent is the name we gave our group project which aims to entertain children age 5-10 with a robot that draws pictures based on their input.

Inspired by the surroundings in the [Central Library](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Central+Library/@52.0774704,4.3135802,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c5b723a383f8e9:0xd0e46b6f6761fee7!8m2!3d52.0774671!4d4.3161551!16s%2Fg%2F1ywqfcs2m?entry=ttu) in The Hague, we started to vent ideas.

## Brainstorm

We used this [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM0f28dc=/?share_link_id=773981393038) to share ideas/links/doubts etc.
